#######################################################
#
#  As we record all learners who started the course survey, we impose a set of 
#  exclusion criteria to define our sample of interest. The learner must have:
#  a. progressed far enough in the survey to be randomized and exposed to condition,
#  b. been exposed just once in the first 30 days following initial exposure,
#  c. started the survey within the first hour of their first timestamp in the course,
#  d1. started a cohort-based course in its first 14 days, OR
#  d2. started a self-paced course before the last 30 days
#

###  Stratified and Nested Design                   ###
#######################################################
#
# The data are collected from a series of treatments embedded in a single procedure that was 
# replicated in many courses, across several schools. Additionally, assignment to treatment
# was stratified across four covariates collected early in the survey. 
#
# Stratification variables: intent_assess, hours, crs_finish, educ
# Stratified: strata_intent_assess (2 levels), strata_hours (2), strata_crs_finish (3), strata_educ (3)
# Strata encoding variables: strata {strata_intent_assess, strata_hours, strata_crs_finish, strata_educ}
# Additional nesting variables: school, course
#
# In every model we control for strata covariates; and nesting within strata, course and school
strata = "+ intent_assess + hours + crs_finish + educ + (1 | school/course) + (1 | strata)"

#######################################################
### Randomized Treatments                           ###
#######################################################
#
# Learners were randomized into cells in a 2x3 between-subjects design.
#
# Factor 1: Affirmation    (affirm / control)
# Factor 2: Plan-Making    (long plans / short plans / control)
#
# Randomization was done within strata
# {strata_intent_assess, strata_hours, strata_crs_finish, strata_educ}
#
#### Variable Names ####
# Binary condition indicators: affirm, plans_long, plans_short
#
### Regression Models ###
models = list()

# only estimates the background covariates/nesting
models[["baseline"]] = "1"

# simple treatment effects with interaction
models[["main.interaction"]] = "affirm * (plans_long + plans_short)" 

#######################################################
### Planned analyses for Affirmation                ###
#######################################################
#
### Primary Analysis - Replicating Prior Findings ###
#
# Affirmation effect in low vs. high HDI countries
# Hypothesis 1a. affirmation supports low-HDI learners (positive coef on affirm)
# Hypothesis 1b. gap between high vs. low HDI regions (positive coef on highHDI)
# Hypothesis 1c. affirmation doesn't support high-HDI learners (negative coef on affirm:highHDI)
models[["simple"]] = "affirm * highHDI + (plans_long + plans_short)"

### Secondary Analysis - Multiple Theory-driven Extensions ###
#
# Affirmation effect by socioeconomic status (based on parental education)
# Expect: affirmation supports low-SES learners
models[["affirm.ses"]] = "affirm * scale(educ_parents) + (scale(HDI) + plans_long + plans_short)"

# Affirmation effect for US racial-ethnic minorities (majority = white/asian/non-hispanic)
# Expect: affirmation supports US minority learners
models[["affirm.minority"]] = "affirm * us_majority + (plans_long + plans_short)"
samples[["US.respondent"]] = samples[["baseline"]] & !is.na(data$us_majority) # respondent in US 

# Affirmation effect moderated by HDI and individual-level national social identity threat (NSIT)
# Expect: affirmation especially supports low-HDI learners with high NSIT
models[["affirm.csit"]] = "affirm * highHDI * scale(threat_country) + (plans_long + plans_short)"

# Affirmation effect moderated by HDI region and individual-level lanuage skill
# Expect: affirmation especially supports low-HDI learners whose English is not fluent
models[["affirm.lang"]] = "affirm * highHDI * is_fluent + (plans_long + plans_short)"

# Affirmation effect by gender and course gender ratio
# Expect: affirmation supports female learners in male-dominated (<20% women) courses
data = ungroup(data %>% group_by(course) %>% mutate(male_dom_course = mean(gender_female) < .2))
models[["affirm.sex"]] = "affirm * gender_female * male_dom_course + (scale(HDI) + plans_long + plans_short)"

### Planned analyses for Plan-Making                ###
#######################################################
#
### Primary Analysis ###
#
# Plan-making effect for short-term and long-term plans
# H2a: Short-term plan-making increase course completion over baseline.
# H2b: Long-term plan-making increase course completion over baseline.
models[["plan.original"]] = "plans_long + plans_short + affirm"

# H2c: Long-term plan-making increase course completion more than short-term plan-making.
data$plans_any = as.numeric(data$plans > 0)
models[["plan.vs.plan"]] = "plans_any + plans_long + affirm"

# Previous plan-making interventions had pre-registered a subgroup for analysis:
# - Fluent English speakers, so that the task would not be effortful
# - Students who intend to complete most/all course assessments, as a masure of follow-through

### Outcomes Measures and Special Samples           ### 
#######################################################
#
# The following analyses are structured based on the priorities specified above.
# The priorities for outcome measures are as follows:
# Primary outcomes: cert_basic (binary), course_progress (percentage)
# Secondary outcomes: cert_verified, upgrade_verified (binary; Harvard/MIT only)
# Tertiary outcome: likely_complete_1 (percentage)
#
### Primary outcome: cert_basic (binary) ###
.y = "cert_basic"
.s = "baseline"
# Note: EdX at Harvard/MIT does not provide "cert_basic" automatically. We will construct it from learner records.

### Primary outcome: course_progress ###
.y = "course_progress"
.s = "baseline"
# Note: We will count the percentage of unique videos watched directly from the tracking data.
# The number of videos per course varies across courses. We will document additional calculations, where necessary.

### Secondary outcome: cert_verified (binary) ###
.y = "cert_verified"
.s = "baseline_HarvardMIT"
# Note: MIT/Harvard only - defining specific sample that excludes learners in Stanford courses
samples[["baseline_HarvardMIT"]] = samples[["baseline"]] & data$school %in% c("Harvard","MIT")
samples[["US.respondent_HarvardMIT"]] = samples[["US.respondent"]] & samples[["baseline_HarvardMIT"]]
samples[["fluent_intent_HarvardMIT"]] = samples[["fluent_intent"]] & samples[["baseline_HarvardMIT"]]

### Secondary outcome: upgrade_verified (binary) ###
.y = "upgrade_verified"
.s = "baseline_upgrades"
# Note: MIT/Harvard only - sample also excludes those who upgraded to verified track pre-exposure
samples[["baseline_upgrades"]] = samples[["baseline_HarvardMIT"]] & data$enroll_verified == 0
samples[["US.respondent_upgrades"]] = samples[["US.respondent"]] & samples[["baseline_upgrades"]]
samples[["fluent_intent_upgrades"]] = samples[["fluent_intent"]] & samples[["baseline_upgrades"]]

### Tertiary outcome likely_complete_1 (percentage) ###
.y = "likely_complete_1"
.s = "baseline"
# Note: This immediate self-report question is to examine the mechanism of the interventions

### Tertiary outcome future sign-ups (count) ###
# .y = "future courses"
# Note: We cannot measure this in our current data but we will calculate it in a year (January 1, 2018)
