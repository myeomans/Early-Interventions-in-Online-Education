#  b. The learner must have started the survey within the first hour of their first timestamp in the course

#### Stratified and Nested Design ####
#######################################################
#
# The data are collected from a series of treatments embedded in a single procedure that was 
# replicated in many courses, across several schools. Additionally, assignment to treatment
# was stratified across four covariates collected early in the survey. 
#
# Stratification variables: intent_assess, hours, crs_finish, educ
# Stratified: strata_intent_assess (2 levels), strata_hours (2), strata_crs_finish (3), strata_educ (3)
# Strata encoding variables: strata {strata_intent_assess, strata_hours, strata_crs_finish, strata_educ}
# Additional nesting variables: school, course
#
# In every model we control for strata covariates; and nesting within strata, course and school
strata = " + intent_assess + hours + crs_finish + educ + (1 | school/course) + (1 | strata)"

#######################################################
#### Randomized Treatments ####
#######################################################
#
# Learners were randomized into cells in a 2x3 between-subjects design.
#
# Factor 1: Affirmation    (affirm / control)
# Factor 2: Plan-Making    (long plans / short plans / control)
#
# Randomization was done within strata
# {strata_intent_assess, strata_hours, strata_crs_finish, strata_educ}
#
#### Variable Names ####
# Binary condition indicators: affirm, plans_long, plans_short

# Affirmation effect moderated by HDI and individual-level country social identity threat
# Expect: affirmation supports learners in low HDI regions, especially those with high threat
models[["affirm.csit"]] = " affirm * scale(HDI) * scale(threat_country) + (plans_long + plans_short)"

# Expect: affirmation supports learners in low HDI regions, especially those whose English is not fluent 
models[["affirm.lang"]] = " affirm * highHDI * is_fluent + (plans_long + plans_short)"

# Affirmation effect by gender and course gender ratio
# Expect: affirmation supports learners of underrepresented (<33%) gender group
